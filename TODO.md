# Bugs
- UpdatePlaceholderPosition() doesnt use the actual ground for reference when casting a ray
- Shaders are applied above the unit select border. The select border should not be obstructed by anything besides UI
- Try using the Moebius shader again, but apply it the same way that I have the outline shader
